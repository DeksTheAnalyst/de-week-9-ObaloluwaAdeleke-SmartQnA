Nigeria gained its independence from British colonial rule on October 1, 1960. 
Before this time, the country had been controlled by Britain for many decades. 
The struggle for independence was led by several nationalists who believed Nigeria should govern itself. 
Leaders such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and Chief Obafemi Awolowo played important roles in guiding the nation toward freedom.

When independence was finally achieved, Nigerians celebrated with hope and excitement. 
The new green and white flag was raised to symbolize peace and agriculture, and the country began its journey as a sovereign nation. 
Although the years after independence brought challenges, the event remains a significant moment in Nigeria’s history and a source of national pride.
