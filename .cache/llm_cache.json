The struggle for self-governance was led by prominent nationalists, including Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Nigerians celebrated this pivotal moment, marking the beginning of their journey as a sovereign nation with a new flag. Despite challenges in the years that followed, independence remains a significant and proud event in Nigeria's history."
